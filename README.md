# Making a Game Assingment
A repository for my second OOP assignment in second year.

#### Brief
- For this assignment I want you use everything you have learned in the class so far to create a classic game using Processing. You can make any game you like. Games Fleadh/Imagine Cup projects are all encouraged or indeed any other competitions. The theme for Games Fleadh this year is "Racing game".

#### My Idea
- I've thought about this for a while and I started with a mini football game although I've gone for something which I think would be better to play and more addictive. I'll be looking to make a similar game to Jetpack Joyride. I have played this game years ago and I'd love to be able to make a similar game to it.
