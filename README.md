# JetScape
A repository for my second OOP assignment in second year.

#### Brief
- For this assignment I want you use everything you have learned in the class so far to create a classic game using Processing. You can make any game you like. Games Fleadh/Imagine Cup projects are all encouraged or indeed any other competitions. The theme for Games Fleadh this year is "Racing game".

#### My Idea
- I've thought about this for a while and I started with a mini football game although I've gone for something which I think would be better to play and more addictive. I'll be looking to make a similar game to Jetpack Joyride. I have played this game years ago and I'd love to be able to make a similar game to it.

#### Objective
- Startup: Include a start menu that has buttons for start, leaderboard and quit.
- Gameplay: Endless runnining collecting coins and avoiding death.
- Death Screen: If player dies then show score and time with an option to return to the main menu.
- Return: Back to the start menu if pressed when player dies.

#### Testing
- Once the stable release was made, I heavily tested this game on a Mac and Windows platform.
- This game was tested on a MacBook, iMac, and a Dell PC.
- Minim library used instead of SoundFile library to make sure that this runs on Windows.
- The program runs as it should, the FPS stays high and does not have any spike lags.

#### Evaluation
- Overall I am satisfied with my program, I have met my goals and added extra to it such as reading from a file for instructions and having a high score system.

- Making the background faster over time was another extra bit added to this game which makes it hard to beat, unlike other endless running games this game can be bet although that's a secret that won't be revealed.

- However it is nearly impossible to beat this game due to the speed change so it would take great skills and possible luck to actually win, but winning in an endless running game? Highly unlikely.

#### Key Features
- Main menu where you can select what to do.
- Polymorphism included.
- Inheritance used.
- File Input included to display instructions for the player.
- Score to keep count of how much coins a player collects.
- High score system to see the highest score a player gets.
- Danger that must be avoided in order to keep playing, otherwise it's game over.
- Awesome sound tracks.
- Cool artwork.
