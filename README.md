# Making a Game Assingment
A repository for my second OOP assignment in second year.

#### Brief
- For this assignment I want you use everything you have learned in the class so far to create a classic game using Processing. You can make any game you like. Games Fleadh/Imagine Cup projects are all encouraged or indeed any other competitions. The theme for Games Fleadh this year is "Racing game".

#### My Idea
- I've thought about this for a while and I started with a mini football game although I've gone for something which I think would be better to play and more addictive. I'll be looking to make a similar game to Jetpack Joyride. I have played this game years ago and I'd love to be able to make a similar game to it.

#### Objective
- Scene 1: Include a start menu that has buttons for start and quit.
- Scene 2: Gameplay: Endless runnining collecting coins and avoiding death.
- Scene 3: If player dies then show score with option to end game or play again.
- Scene 4: Back to the start menu if pressed when player dies.
